  # Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Rivki Zohar
My passion lies in learning, exploring and writing code. ðŸ’»  
Since the day I wrote my first "Hello World!" and discovered the world of web development I have been hooked.

Now, aside from being a practical software engineer student (only two semesters left!), I invest time to learn things on my own, develop my skills and expand my knowledge. 

I actively seek out new challenges and opportunities to grow. I have completed online courses, participated in coding challenges, and joined an open-source community.

Currently, I am seeking a student position to apply my skills and gain real-world experience.
